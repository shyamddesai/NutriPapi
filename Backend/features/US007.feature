Feature: Meal Preparation Reminders
  As a user,
  I want to receive timely reminders for meal preparation
  so that I can prepare my meals on time and maintain my health routines.

  Scenario: Receive reminders to begin meal preparation (Normal Flow)
    Given the user is logged into the NutriPapi system and navigates to the meals section
    When a meal is scheduled within the next one hour
    Then the system should display a reminder message on the page for the upcoming meal.

  Scenario: User logs in outside of scheduled meal reminder times (Alternate Flow)
    Given the user is logged into the NutriPapi system and navigates to the meal section outside of scheduled meal reminder times
    When the user checks the dashboard or meal log section
    Then the system should not display any reminder message for meal preparation.

  Scenario: No meal suggestions available for reminders (Error Flow)
    Given the user is logged into the NutriPapi system and navigates to the meals section
    When there are no meal suggestions available
    Then the system should inform the user that no reminders can be provided
