Feature: Cross-Device Compatibility

  As a user who uses multiple devices,
  I want the NutriPapi system to be responsive and compatible on all my devices
  so that I can access my meal plans and health tracking.

  Scenario: Accessing NutriPapi on Different Devices (Normal Flow)
    Given the user has multiple devices
    When the user accesses the NutriPapi system from each device
    Then the system should render properly on all devices, allowing seamless access to meal plans and health tracking features

  Scenario: Testing Compatibility on New Device (Alternate Flow)
    Given the user acquires a new device
    When the user accesses the NutriPapi system for the first time on the new device
    Then the system should adapt to the new device's specifications and display content properly, maintaining compatibility

  Scenario: Compatibility Issues on Specific Device (Error Flow)
    Given the user attempts to access the NutriPapi system on a specific device
    When the system encounters compatibility issues on that device
    Then the system should provide guidance or troubleshooting steps to resolve the compatibility issues, ensuring access across all devices
